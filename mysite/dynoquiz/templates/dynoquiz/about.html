            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                In 2013 I was asked to develop a website for a clinical research lab. They wanted a way that they
                could ask questions to their patients and record their responses locally to avoid any issues with HIPAA.
                With little experience involving how to build a websites I went about building them what I could. The end result
                was a very static PHP site with a MySql DB. The app did the job but it didn't allow test administrators to edit the 
                questions or choices of their tests without knowing how to edit and deploy code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The poor quality of my work still bothers me however I'm' trying to learn from the experience.
                Since then, when learning a new language or framework, my first capstone project is to build a
                quiz distribution app that doesn't require the administrator to know anything about web development to 
                create/distribute/edit their quizzes. The app has little practical meaning now, but the CRUD operations 
                are a good step in the right direction to mastering a new language/framework.
